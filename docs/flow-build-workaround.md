# Flow SDK Build Workaround

## The Problem
The PhysX Flow SDK you have fails to build `nvflowext.dll` due to compiler warnings being treated as errors (`/WX` flag):
- `warning C4756: overflow in constant arithmetic` in `NvFlowRayMarchUtils.h` and `EmitterMesh.cpp`
- This is a known issue with strict MSVC warning settings

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Use Pre-built Flow Binaries (RECOMMENDED)
If NVIDIA provides pre-built Flow binaries for PhysX 5.6.1, download them instead of building from source.

### Option 2: Patch premake5.lua and Rebuild
1. Edit `PhysX/flow/premake5.lua` line 24
2. Change: `flags { "FatalCompileWarnings", "NoPCH", "NoIncrementalLink" }`
3. To: `flags { "NoPCH", "NoIncrementalLink" }`
4. Regenerate and rebuild:
   ```pwsh
   cd PhysX/flow
   .\generate_projects.bat vs2022
   .\build.bat
   ```

### Option 3: Minimal Flow Integration (CURRENT)
**We've implemented a workaround that doesn't require nvflowext.dll:**
- Our bridge now uses only `nvflow.dll` for basic device/context creation
- This is sufficient for the initial integration and callback system
- Later features (grids, emitters, raymarch) can be added when nvflowext builds successfully

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ `nvflow.dll` is available in `PhysX/flow/_build/windows-x86_64/debug/`
- ‚úÖ Our bridge (`unity_physx_flow.dll`) builds successfully
- ‚ùå `nvflowext.dll` build fails (not critical for basic integration)
- üî≤ Advanced features requiring nvflowext postponed until build issue resolved

## Testing Without nvflowext
You can test the basic bridge now:
1. Copy `unity_physx_flow.dll` to Unity `Assets/Plugins/x86_64/`
2. Copy `nvflow.dll` (and slang DLLs) next to Unity.exe
3. Run the example - it will log that nvflowext failed to load but device creation should work if using basic APIs

## Next Steps
1. Contact NVIDIA or check Flow SDK documentation for pre-built binaries
2. Or apply the premake5.lua patch above
3. Once nvflowext.dll is available, our bridge will automatically use its advanced features
